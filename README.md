# PSE Good First Issues Tracker

Note: Due to current issues with Github permissions, a mirror (may not be most up-to-date) is hosted here: https://pse-good-first-issues.vercel.app/

This is a simple frontend/backend to grab all the "good first issues" from a number of Github orgs/repos.

Starting from a list of orgs/repos, we use GraphQL to query the Github endpoint for their issues. And then we filter for issues that have the tag "good-first-issues" (and slight variations). We then simply add them up and give people a simple frontend to view the list.
